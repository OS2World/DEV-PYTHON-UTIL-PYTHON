This is an adaption of the BSD DB library supplied by Eberhard Mattes in 
the EMXBSD archive within the EMX tool suite.

I have changed the makefiles to use GNU make (rather than dmake), and 
made changes to support linkage to multithreaded apps.

The multithread support required source changes in 3 files in the hash 
directory.

All new makefiles are included in directory structure matching the original,
with context diffs for the changed source files.
