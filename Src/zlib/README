Because I wanted to statically link the zlib library to avoid clashes with 
the numerous incompatible DLLs floating around the Internet, I modified 
the OS2 EMX specific makefile included with the zlib 1.2.3 distribution 
to build only static libraries with multithreading support and fairly 
conservative optimisation.

No source changes were necessary.
